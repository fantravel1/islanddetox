          <h2>About This Stay</h2>
          <p>The Pine Cabin sits halfway up a hillside above Votsi cove on Alonnisos, the most remote of Greece's Northern Sporades islands and the gateway to the largest marine protected area in Europe. The cabin was built by Yannis, a local carpenter who spent forty years making fishing boats before his hands told him to stop. He built it the way he built boats: with Aleppo pine harvested from the island's interior, hand-planed and fitted without nails where he could manage it, the joints so tight you can run your finger along them and feel nothing but a whisper of seam. The wood has never been painted. It has aged to the colour of dark honey, and the whole structure smells of resin, pine sap, and the salt air that permeates everything on Alonnisos within a week.</p>

          <p>The cabin is small in the way that good boats are small: everything has its place, and the economy of the design creates a feeling not of confinement but of sufficiency. The main room is a single open space with a sleeping platform at one end, raised two steps above the floor and fitted with a thick cotton futon and linen sheets. A wooden table by the window seats two. The kitchen is a pine countertop with a two-burner gas stove, a small refrigerator, and open shelving holding a few white plates, two wine glasses, and a ceramic oil jug. There is one comfortable reading chair, positioned by the window that faces the sea, and a small shelf of books, mostly natural history and poetry, the kind of books that make sense in a place like this.</p>

          <p>What makes the Pine Cabin extraordinary is its setting. It sits in a grove of Aleppo pines, the trees so close that their branches brush the roof when the wind blows, making a sound like slow, patient breathing. The pines filter the sunlight into a green-gold haze that moves across the wooden floor throughout the day. From the small terrace, built from the same pine as the cabin and cantilevered slightly over the slope, you can see through the trees to Votsi cove below: a crescent of pebble beach, water so clear it looks like blue glass, and usually no more than two or three boats at anchor. The path from the cabin to the water takes seven minutes, winding through the pines and down stone steps that someone carved into the hillside decades ago. By August, the pine needles on the path are warm underfoot.</p>

          <p>Alonnisos itself is an island that most tourists pass through on their way to the marine park boat trips and then leave. This is a gift. The old town, Chora, sits on the hilltop like a Greek village from a postcard that predates postcards: stone houses with blue shutters, bougainvillea erupting from every wall, cats sleeping in doorways, and a view from the top that extends across the Aegean to the uninhabited islands of the marine park, where monk seals breed in sea caves and dolphins surface in pods of twenty or thirty. The island has perhaps three thousand residents in winter, swelling to maybe ten thousand in summer, but the cabin is far enough from the port town that you would never know it. Your neighbours are pine trees, cicadas, and the occasional goat.</p>

          <h2>Why It's Verified</h2>
          <p>We spent five nights at the Pine Cabin in early June. The cabin has no television and no Wi-Fi. There is a shared connection available at the small taverna in Votsi, a ten-minute walk down the hill, but the password changes weekly and the signal is unreliable enough that checking email becomes an act of such sustained effort that you abandon it after the first attempt, which is exactly the point. The phone lockbox is a cedarwood box that Yannis made from offcuts, fitted with a brass clasp. The mattress is a high-density cotton futon, firmer than a hotel bed and better for it, replaced annually. The blackout curtains are heavy canvas sailcloth, rigged on a brass rail that Yannis salvaged from a boat. They block every photon of light and make the cabin dark as a ship's hold.</p>

          <p>The quiet here is not silence but rather the absence of human noise. What remains is the wind in the pines, the cicadas that start their electric hum around ten in the morning and continue until dusk, and the sea, which you can hear from the cabin as a low, rhythmic wash against the pebbles of Votsi cove. At night, the sounds narrow to the trees and the occasional soft splash of something in the water below, a fish jumping or a seal surfacing. The food situation is ideal for detox: the cabin is self-catering, with the taverna at the bottom of the hill serving grilled fish, horta, and salads made from vegetables grown in the owner's garden. It is the kind of food that makes you realise most of what you eat at home is noise. The journaling kit is a cloth-bound notebook and a pencil, because Yannis does not trust pens near wood.</p>

          <h2>What to Expect</h2>
          <p>You wake to the sound of pine trees and light that comes through the branches in moving patterns on the wooden walls. The cabin has the particular warmth of a wooden structure that has absorbed the previous day's sun: even at seven in the morning, the air inside smells of warm resin. Coffee on the gas stove, Greek style, gritty and strong, taken on the terrace while the cove below is still in shadow and the water is the dark blue of early morning. Breakfast is bread from the bakery in Patitiri, honey, yoghurt, fruit. Then the day belongs entirely to you. The path to the water is seven minutes. You swim. The water in June is cool enough to feel like a decision, warm enough by August to feel like an embrace. You dry on the pebbles. You walk back up through the pines. You read in the chair by the window. The hours pass without announcing themselves. Around midday, the heat settles into the trees and the cicadas reach their full volume, a sound so constant it becomes a kind of silence.</p>

          <p>Late afternoon is the golden hour on Alonnisos, when the light turns the pine bark orange and the sea below shifts from blue to copper. You walk down to the taverna, where Katerina serves grilled octopus, a salad of tomatoes and cucumbers that taste the way those words are supposed to taste, and a glass of cold white wine from the mainland. You eat slowly, watching the fishing boats return to Votsi. The walk back up the hill in the fading light, through pines that are releasing the last of the day's heat in waves of scent, is one of the most pleasant ten minutes you will spend anywhere. Back at the cabin, the evening is lamplight and the sound of the sea through open windows. The sailcloth curtains wait for when you are ready. The notebook and pencil sit on the table. You will find, by the third or fourth evening, that you are writing less about what you did and more about what you are beginning to feel, which is the whole point of coming to a place like this.</p>

          <h2>Getting There</h2>
          <p>Fly into Skiathos Airport, which receives domestic flights from Athens and seasonal charters from several European cities. From Skiathos, take the ferry to Alonnisos via Skopelos. The journey takes about ninety minutes and passes through some of the most beautiful island-hopping water in the Aegean, green islands rising from a sea that shifts between turquoise and navy. The ferry docks at Patitiri, the island's small port town. From there, Votsi is a five-minute drive or a twenty-minute walk along the coastal road. Yannis will meet you at the taverna in Votsi and walk you up the path to the cabin. He will point out which pine trees he used for which parts of the building. He will show you how to light the stove, where the torch is kept for the path at night, and which rock on the beach is the best for entering the water. Then he will leave, and the quiet will arrive, and you will understand why he chose to build here.</p>
